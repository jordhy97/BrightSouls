       In the Valley of Emraud,

          There was a kingdom

       A land of the Garmaritan

          Led by two brothers

             Lyon and you

     The kingdom of Horem was dark

          Only the moon shine

         For hundreds of years

      Betrayed by their late king

     Curse that hasn't been lifted

    And then from the darkness came

         The witch of Mevalis

        Vizek wanted the throne

  As he was the heir of the late king

  The whole kingdom fought against him

    But no one could stop the witch

  Knowing the throne has been occupied

           Vizek killed Lyon

            And once again

      The whole kingdom is cursed

       To bow to their new king

    you ran away to another kingdom

   Thus avoid the curse of the witch

you swore to avenge your brother's death

     And seize your kingdom back.*
